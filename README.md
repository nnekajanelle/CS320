In this class, I mostly worked on using Java to build and test the main features of a mobile app.  In Project One, I built and tried a Contact service. In Project Two, I wrote a summary and reflection report.  I learned to write clean code and make sure it meets user goals through software design.

I used JUnit unit tests to check for errors and to make sure it works and is safe.  This found bugs quickly and made sure the computer did what it was supposed to do.  Also, I made sure that input validations were in place to keep data correct and stop mistakes.

 Knowing what people want is a big part of making good tools.  I learned how to read carefully and break them down into smaller parts so that I could make features that really do what the user wants.  I made sure the contact ID can't be changed helps keep data consistent.

I break it down into easy steps. I ask questions like how the data should be organized, and how the user will interact with it.  To keep my code organized and flexible, I used object-oriented design principles. I wrote code that would be simple to test.

The projects made me better at testing and making sure software works well, and I'm happy to have them in my portfolio.
